 There is often talk on how software/APIs/appliances should be user friendly and of course they should. But I like to make a distinction between (power) user friendliness and newbie user friendliness. So what is the distinction and can the two be combined? And if you have to choose, which is better?

My focus is software and development but I find this is true for almost everything that surrounds us in life from packaging to doors and cars. Some things are easy to understand and use at first glance, but hide options you need when you are experienced. Others are a mystery at first but when you become a power user the possibilities are endless. Read [The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Everyday-Things-Don-Norman/dp/0465067107) by Donald Norman for more input on the subject.

* Convention over configuration

### User Friendliness

* Hackable
* customizable
* Extendable
* Convention over configuration
* Easy things a no-brainer, hard things possible (not virtually impossible without a ton of XML, like Maven).


### How to
* *DD
* User input
