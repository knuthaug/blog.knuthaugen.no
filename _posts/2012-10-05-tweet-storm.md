A while back I experience the full force of Twitter in a nutshell. I am not a very active twitter user, but I follow som celebrity developers and once in a while I throw out a tweet in reply to one. This normally just leads to (at best) a few tweets back and forth and nothing more. But not this time. I responded to a discussion between Ted Neward TK and Scott Hanselman TK, both with a sizable number of followers. They were talking about some presentation from Microsoft on best practises. I spoke my mind on it:

<p style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; line-height: 130%;">«There are no best practices, there are only practices and their suitability depends on the context.»</p>
