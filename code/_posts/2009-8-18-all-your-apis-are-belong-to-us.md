I saw the link to <a href="http://gotapi.com/">gotapi.com</a> link referenced from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/63918/what-is-the-best-online-javascript-css-html-xhtml-dom-reference">stackoverflow question 63918</a> and if you're like me and program in multiple languages and multiple frameworks it is the closest thing I've found to a one stop website for API references. It acts as a wrapper around API docs and specs from all over the web and covers things like Java API, JQuery (albeit an older version), Python, PHP, GWT, Ruby (and Rails), HTML, CSS XSL/XPATH/XSD, Perl and much more. And to top it off, you can cherrypick which ones to search in at <a href="http://start.gotapi.com/">start.gotapi.com</a>. This replaces <em>a lot</em> of bookmarks for me.
