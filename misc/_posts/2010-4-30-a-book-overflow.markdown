I am a habitual book buyer and I kinda like the paper kind which is evident if you see my office shelf or my living room. So once again I bought more books than I can read in the time I have left from living my normal life.

### Growing software

[Growing Object-oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Signature/dp/0321503627/) By Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce. This is a book I've only heard positive things about and the TOC seem to deliver on that. It offers a lot of details on the how and more important the why of TDD/BDD and testing in relation to development. I am _so_ looking forward to this one.

### Being Productive

[The Productive Programmer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Productive-Programmer-Theory-Practice-OReilly/dp/0596519788) by Neal Ford. I'm a productivity junkie just like Neal Ford and some of the tricks (and the first part of the book is a long list of tools and tips) are already in my tool belt. But there's always more to learn, all in the spirit of kaizen. He throws in some good advice on software design also, all in the spirit of being productive.

### The Art of Agile

[The Art of Agile Software Development](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/) by James Shore and Chromatic. Another one I have heard a lot about and all positive. By the first look it seems to cover the state of agile software development today and touches on some lean and TPS-inspired concepts too. And you can't really navigate around that in today's agile landscape.

### Effective Java

[Effective Java second edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Effective-Java-Second-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/) by Joshua Block. I'll be writing more Java in the coming months as I'll be changing jobs so this is in order to brush up on the old java skills. Also a book that is widely regarded as a must.

### The Legacy You Inherit

[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/) by Michael Feathers. How do you test legacy apps? Highly recommended by a colleague who recently inherited a largish legacy codebase with only a tauntingly small amount of tests. What's the definition of legacy code? Code without tests :-) Even if you write it today...
