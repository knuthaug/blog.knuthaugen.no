 This is a list of all the books I've read that are in some way related to programming and software development, along with some thoughts on them.
### Languages
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177">The Ruby Programming Language</a> by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto. Really a comprehensive guide to Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9, but not a "how-to program" type of book. Simply wonderful information density and one of the clearest programming books I've read in a long time.</li>
	<li>Programming C# 3.0</li>
	<li>C# 3.0 Cookbook</li>
	<li>C# 3.0 Design patterns by Judith Bishop. A nice overview of common design patterns and how best to implement them in C#.</li>
	<li>Programming Perl. A must when beginning to program Perl. Nice reference and enough depth to keep you going for a long time.</li>
	<li>Practical mod_perl</li>
	<li>Perl Best Practices by Damian Conway</li>
	<li>Higher-order Perl by Mark Jason Dominus. This is a gem of a book for every Perl developer that wishes to expand her repertoire of tricks, but not suitable for beginners. It tackles topics such as memoization, currying, recursion and iterators, recursive-descent parsers and other neat stuff for transforming code using code.</li>
	<li>Perl Cookbook. A collection of recipes for solving small and large problems in idiomatic Perl.</li>
	<li>Perl Testing by Ian langworth and Chromatic. Nice rundown of Perl testing covering both Test::Class and Test::More. It's in the developer notebooks series so it's really hands on all the way through.</li>
	<li>Javascript: The Definite Guide.</li> 
       <li>Javascript: the good parts by Douglas Crockford. What is says on the cover. Really.</li>
	<li>Ansi Common Lisp by Paul Graham. I would say this book can be compared to Kernigan & Ritchie's The C Programming Language. More parenthesis, though.</li>
	<li>XSLT 2.0 by Michael Kay. Handy reference for those times when there's no way to escape XSLT. </li>
</ul>
### Methodology
<ul>
	<li>Agile Software Development with Scrum By Ken Schwaber</li>
	<li><a title="amazon: Agile estimating and planning" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Robert-Martin/dp/0131479415/">Agile Estimating and planning</a> by Mike Cohn. A very nice book covering a lot of nooks and crannies regarding estimating and planning agile software development. I would say a must for all people involved in agile projects.</li>
	<li>Agile Software development by Alistair Cockburn. One of the best discussions on agile software development as a field, without stranding on specific methodologies. A very good read, especially the parts on communication and individuals.</li>
	<li>Test-driven Development by Dave Astels</li>
	<li>The Pragmatic Programmer by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt</li>
	<li>Continuous Integration by Paul M. Duvall.  Didn't tell me much I didn't already know, but gives a nice overview of continous integration for newbies in the field. </li>
	<li>Pragmatic Project Automation by Mike Clark. Quite basic rundown of the task of automating all (as many as possible) tasks in building a software project. Beginner-level. </li>
	<li>Xunit Test Patterns by Gerard Meszaros. High-level discussion of test patterns for development. Testing in a TDD/BDD sense. </li>
	<li>Junit Recipes by J.B. Rainsberger</li>
	<li>Clean Code by Robert C. Martin.</li>
      <li>Scrumban by Corey Ladas.</li>
        <li>Code Complete 2nd edition by Steve McConnel. A bible on software development in many ways. Packed with useful advice even though a lot is common knowledge if you been around for a few years. </li>
 <li>Scrum and Kanban - making the most of both by Henrik Kniberg and Mattias Skarin</li>
<li>Kanban - Successful Evolutionary Change for Technology Organizations by David Anderson</li>
	<li>Extreme Programming explained by Kent Beck</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1248250805&amp;sr=8-3">Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices</a></li>
</ul>
### Design and architecture
