A nearly complete set of videos of the talks at the Lean &amp;amp; Kanban 2009 conference in Miami is available at <a href="http://www.sep.com/lk2009">http://www.sep.com/lk2009</a> with talks from among others Corey Ladas on <a href="http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/">scrumban</a>, Alan Shalloway on going beyond Toyota, David Anderson on Kanban, Karl Scotland on Kanban flow and cadence and Amit Rethore on why agile isn't enough. All familiar names from the kanbandev Yahoo group which I started to follow recently.<br /><br />Now I just hope I find enough time to watch some of them.
