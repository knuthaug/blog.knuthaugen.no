# About page

Knut Haugen [Knu:t Hæugen] is a Norwegian software developer with a soft spot for dynamic languages, DevOps and anything to with developer testing. Writes mostly typescript by day and create streaming video and audio players. I am an agile methodology geek with bias on Lean and Kanban. I ride mountain bikes and drink proper beer, but not at the same time.

I automate, therefore I am.
