I'm working hard these days putting the finishing touches on my presentation for this years <a href="http://jz11.java.no/">JavaZone</a> conference. It is a privilege to be able to talk there and I thank the organizer for giving me a full hour on the topic. I will be talking on the subject of deployment pipelines using <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins CI</a> as the tool, and going through a lot of techniques and scenarios for evolving a pipeline to match your context. And reasons for creating a pipeline in the first place. I gave a lightning talk at the Roots conference in May on the same topic, but there was a lot more to be said than fitted in ten minutes. Hope to see a lot of people there!

And on the subject of continuous delivery: I wrote two blog posts on CD and deployment pipelines a while ago and promised a third one. The third one <i>is</i> coming, but I won't make any promises as to when. I am starting a new job September 1st, at <a href="http://apdm.no/">APressen Digitale Medier</a> and I am guessing things will be hectic. Mountain biking season is soon ending and I guess I'll get some more time when winter hits. I'll also be spending the winter doing some more ruby stuff and doing HTML5 and other front end work on the <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">munin project</a> and the upcoming 2.0 release.
