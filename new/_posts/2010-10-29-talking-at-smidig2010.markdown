 I'm super excited that I got one (so far, they normally only accept one per person) of my abstracts for the Norwegian Agile conference [Smidig 2010](http://smidig2010.no/) in Oslo 16. and 17. of November. This is my first proper conference talk even though I have been giving talks in other context to large audiences in the past. 

The talk title is hard to translate but the topic is on the agility of NoSQL databases in general and document databases in particular and I will be contrasting old school relational databases to new school document databases in areas such as management, testing, development friction etc. 

And the conference in itself is super cool with three tracks of four 10-minute lightning talks before lunch and open spaces crowd sourced by the participants after lunch, both days. I attended previous two years and it's a blast.
