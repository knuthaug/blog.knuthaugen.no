I gave a talk on web performance and web performance API on May 22th 2025 on a mini conference for developers and  platform engineers in the public sector in Norway. This is just a quick post linking the talk slides, as PDF, and references and sources for the talk, for anyone interested. Talk and slides are in Norwegian, but all sources are in English.
